# Putting the FUN in functions!

1. Triangulate It

Create a function called triangleChecker.
* It should take three numbers as arguments.
* Each of those arguments represents an angle.
* If those three numbers add up to 180, then return true.
* If those three numbers do not add up to 180, then return false.

2. FizzBuzz

Create a function called fizzBuzz.
When fizzBuzz(maxNumber) is executed, it should do the following up to the maxNumber:
* If a number is divisible by 3, it should log the word "Fizz" to the console.
* If a number is divisible by 5, it should log "Buzz".
* If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, it should log "FizzBuzz".
* Otherwise, it should just log the number.

3. Function of Thrones

Create a function called characterHouse.
* This function should take two string arguments: firstName and houseName.
* When executed, the function should return "firstName, house of houseName".

Example:
```
characterHouse("Tyrion", "Lannister");
=> "Tyrion, house of Lannister."
```
