# Putting the FUN in functions!

## Function of Thrones

Create a function called characterHouse.
* This function should take two string arguments: firstName and houseName.
* When executed, the function should return "firstName, house of houseName".

Example:
```
characterHouse("Tyrion", "Lannister");
// output => "Tyrion, house of Lannister."
```

## Triangulate It

Create a function called triangleChecker.
* It should take three numbers as arguments.
* Each of those arguments represents an angle.
* If those three numbers add up to 180, then return true.
* If those three numbers do not add up to 180, then return false.

## FizzBuzz

Everyone's favorite! Create a function called fizzBuzz.

When fizzBuzz(maxNumber) is executed, it should do the following up to the maxNumber:
* If a number is divisible by 3, it should log the word "Fizz" to the console.
* If a number is divisible by 5, it should log "Buzz".
* If a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, it should log "FizzBuzz".
* Otherwise, it should just log the number.

## More Function Fun!

1. Declare a function called `bigBackwards` that takes a single string as an argument and returns that string backwards and uppercase.

2. Declare a function called `informedCounter` that takes a string and returns a string explaining the size of that string.

Example output:
```
"The word 'dog' has 3 letters!"
```

3. Declare a function called `bigArray` that takes an array of strings and returns that array of string with all the letters uppercased.

4. Declare a function called `luckyNumber` that takes two numbers as arguments and returns "Unlucky!" if the sum of those numbers is divisible by 13, and "Lucky!" if not.
