# Loop De-Loop!

1. Pete and Repeat

* Prompt the user: "Pete and Repete are on a boat. Pete falls off. Who's left?"
* If the user inputs Repete, repeat (wink wink) the joke.
* Otherwise, tell the user, "You are no fun!"

2. Contact Loop 
* Prerequisite: "Call Me, Maybe?" (nested_structures.md)

* Loop over your contact list, and print out the names AND ages of everyone in the list.
