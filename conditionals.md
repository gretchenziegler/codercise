# Conditionals

## Color Conditions

Chartreuse is my favorite color. Magenta is my second favorite. Periwinkle is my third favorite. I hate every other color!
* Write a conditional that will check a variable set to a color and tell me how I feel about it.

```
var color = "Magenta";
```
*Bonus:* Turn your color conditional into a function called colorChecker that takes any color as an argument.

## Conditioner Conditional
Create a function that takes three arguments: the current temperature, whether the A/C is functional or not, and the desired temperature.

  - If the air conditioner is functional and the current temperture is above the the desired temperature, print the string "Turn on the A/C Please"
  - If the air conditioner is non-functional and the current temperture is above the the desired temperature, print the string "Fix the A/C now!  It's hot!"
  - If the air conditioner is non-functional and the current temperture is below the the desired temperature, print the string "Fix the A/C whenever you have the chance...  It's cool..."

## Palindrome Checker

Create a function that takes a word or phrase and checks whether or not it's a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward).
