Call Me, Maybe?

With your neighbor, and in your text editor of choice, construct a contact list. The list should have at least three contacts in it, and each contact should have a name, an age, and a list of his or her favorite foods. All of this information should be stored inside of a single variable - contacts. Take some time to draw out the structure of your contact list prior to building it!

var contacts = [];

If you finish creating your contact list, do the following:

1. Access the name of person #2.

2. Person #3 just had a birthday! Update his or her age.

3. Person #2 is coming over for dinner. Access the second food in his or her list.

4. Add "beets" to the favorite foods of person #1. Yum!

5. Person #3 suddenly had a change of heart about the last food in his or her list. Remove it.

6. Person #2 backstabbed you. Delete him or her entirely from your contacts.

7. You are making friends! Add a completely new person to the beginning of your contacts.
