# Wine Cellar

Someone with disposable income has hired you to manage his or her wine cellar. They have provided you with data with which you can start (below).

```ruby
wine_cellar = [
  {"label" => "Rutherford Hill", "type" => "Chardonnay", "color" => "white"},
  {"label" => "Nina Veneto", "type" => "Pinot Grigio", "color" => "white"},
  {"label" => "Wairau River", "type" => "Sauvignon Blanc", "color" => "white"},
  {"label" => "Tangley Oaks", "type" => "Merlot", "color" => "red"},
  {"label" => "Chimney Rock", "type" => "cabernet Sauvignon", "color" => "red"},
  {"label" => "Sanford", "type" => "Pinot Noir", "color" => "red"},
  {"label" => "Alderbrook", "type" => "Pinot Noir", "color" => "red"},
  {"label" => "Colavita", "type" => "Pinot Noir", "color" => "red"},
  {"label" => "Markham", "type" => "Chardonnay", "color" => "white"},
  {"label" => "Angeline", "type" => "Pinot Noir", "color" => "red"}
]
```

## Directions:
1. Add a wine of your choice to the back of the cellar. Structure this wine as a hash with the keys `"color"`, `"type"`, and `"label"`.
2. Change the label of "Wairai River" to "Fritz Chicagoland Vineyards".
3. Change the color of "Fritz Chicagoland Vineyards" to "beige".
4. Print out the names(labels) of all the wines.
5. Print out the colors of all the wines.
6. Print out the types of all the wines.
7. Print out the labels of all 'Pinot Noir' wines.
8. Create a new array containing only red wines.
9. Change the color of all white wines to 'orange'.
10. Create a new array containing all wines except Pinot Noirs.
