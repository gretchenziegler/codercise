# My Beautiful Dark Twisted Enumeration Exercise

```
kanyeRecords = [
  { year: 2016, title: "The Life of Pablo" },
  { year: 2013, title: "Yeezus" },
  { year: 2011, title: "Watch the Throne" },
  { year: 2010, title: "My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy" },
  { year: 2008, title: "808s and Heartbreak" },
  { year: 2007, title: "Graduation" },
  { year: 2005, title: "Late Registration" },
  { year: 2004, title: "The College Dropout" }
]
```


## Programmatically do the following:

  - Print the name of every Kanye record.
  - Print the year every Kanye record was released.
  - Look into the future and add a forthcoming Kanye record into our array. It should be released in 2020 and have a title that is completely asinine.
  - Iterate through Kanye's record collection and print out the titles of all the records released after Kanye's ego exploded (this happened in 2007).
  - Iterate through the collection. For each record, print out a sentence detailing each record (e.g. "'Graduation' was released in 2007.").
  - Iterate through collection. add a key value pair to each record with the key as `:label` and the value as `"def jam"`.

  ***BONUS***
  - Iterate through the collection. If a record's title contains more than 15 letters, print `"That's a long title."`
  - Iterate through the collection. replace the letter 'o' in each record title with the number 0.
