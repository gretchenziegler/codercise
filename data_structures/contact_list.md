# Call Me, Maybe?

Construct a contact list.
* The list should have at least three contacts in it.
* Each contact should have a name, an age, and a list of his or her favorite foods.
* All of this information should be stored inside of a single variable - contacts.
Hint: Take some time to draw out the structure of your contact list prior to building it!

```
var contacts = [];
```

If you finish creating your contact list, copy the data into your console and do the following programmatically:
* Access the name of person #2.
* Person #3 just had a birthday! Update his or her age.
* Person #2 is coming over for dinner. Access the second food in his or her list.
* Add "beets" to the favorite foods of person #1. Yum!
* Person #3 suddenly had a change of heart about the last food in his or her list. Remove it.
* Person #2 backstabbed you. Delete him or her entirely from your contacts.
* You are making friends! Add a completely new person to the beginning of your contacts.
