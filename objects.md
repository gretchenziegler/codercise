**MMMM...Flavorful Objects!**

Create an object representing the following foods: avocados, steak, grass, whiskey, muffins, fish, and soap.

Avocados are fresh, steak is meaty, grass is fiber-filled, whiskey is smooth, muffins are sweet, fish is mercury-tastic, and soap is disgusting. Here is some starter code:

```
var foods = {
  avocados: "fresh",
  steak: "meaty",
};
```

* Once your object is made, add 5 more foods and their flavors to your object.
* Avocados are full of that good fat. Change the avocado value to be "fatty".
* Muffins are super unhealthy. Change the value for muffins to be "carbtastic".
* Soap? Who would eat soap? Delete that from your object.
* The fish went bad. The flavor of fish should be "rotten".
* Juice cleanse! Add "raw carrot juice" to your object with the flavor "wallet draining good".
* Atkins diet! Get those muffins out of that object.
* Time to dry yourself out. Delete whiskey from the object.
* You just moved to Park Slope! Add "gluten free bread" to your object with the flavor "flavorless".
* Time to fast. Delete everything from the object!
